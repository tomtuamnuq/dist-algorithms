# Distributed Algorithms

This repository stores visualizations of several distributed algorithms. To apply the algorithms, `src/networks` contains functions to create three different graph topologies.

Please see the Jupyter Notebook `Network-Plots` for examples of graph topologies.

For each of the three implemented algorithms exists a Notebook with a visualization.

## Echo

## General Election Algorithm

## Lift
